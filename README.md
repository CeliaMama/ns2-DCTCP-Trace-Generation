network topology: 8 nodes sending TCP traffic to a receiver through a router (RED queue).

In simpleDumbbell.tcl, all 8 nodes running the same TCP protocol while in simpleDumbbell_CompetingTraffic.tcl one node running NewReno, the other 7 running DCTCP. 

Check the two default trace-all outXXXXXX.tr (tf) trace files generated by the two tcl files, you will find part of the DCTCP trace lost in the competing traffic case:

Just DCTCP:
+ 0.040001 0 8 tcp 1500 ------N 0 0.0 9.0 1461 18 1 0x10 40 0


Competing traffic:
- 0.050112 8 9 tcp 1500 ------N 0 0.0 9.0 1461 18

We need to figure out why this happens.
